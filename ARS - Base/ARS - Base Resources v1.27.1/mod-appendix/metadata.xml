<![CDATA[
This mod contains the resources for the Arsenal+ game expansion. Must be loaded alongside the Arsenal+ English Data mod for Arsenal+ to work properly.

Adds weapons, drones, etc. assets from the FTL: Captain's Edition mod, found here: https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=15663, improves graphics and much more. Not all the graphics assets(sprites, weapon art, etc.) were created by the makers of this mod: some assets from different mods from the official game forum are incorporated into this mod.
  
Captain's Edition's assets are correctly given credit; this can be found on this mod's official forum page.

    Suggestions for the description...

    Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship,
    how does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

    Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

    Optionally list important features.

    List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or
    requirements.

    Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.
      Kestrel-A, Stealth-A, Mantis-A,
      Engi-A,    Fed-A,     Slug-A,
      Rock-A,    Zoltan-A,  Crystal-A

    Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
    that again for each new version.
