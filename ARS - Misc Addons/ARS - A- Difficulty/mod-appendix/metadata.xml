<![CDATA[
Should be used after the base Arsenal+ mod. Not supposed to be used alongside its counterpart, the A+ addon.

Makes Arsenal+ slightly easier in the following ways:

- Enemy ships' core systems have at most 3-9 power capacity instead of 4-10 power capacity
- Benefits from talking to crew are more likely to occur
- Augment Special Features no longer have purely negative outcomes
- Intact prototype weaponry requires 3 power instead of 4 power
- Equal distribution of every sector type, instead of homeworld-type sectors being rare

    Suggestions for the description...

    Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship,
    how does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

    Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

    Optionally list important features.

    List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or
    requirements.

    Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.
      Kestrel-A, Stealth-A, Mantis-A,
      Engi-A,    Fed-A,     Slug-A,
      Rock-A,    Zoltan-A,  Crystal-A

    Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
    that again for each new version.
