# Arsenal+ English
FTL: Faster Than Light is an indie roguelike strategy game that puts you in command of a starship on a last-ditch mission to bring vital data to Federation headquarters. This mod, Arsenal+, is an ongoing overhaul of the game created by Russian fans that adds a plethora of new sectors, weapons, factions and more! This is my attempt at an English version of the mod, adding a little bit of my own flair here and there, most of all hoping to capture the best version of this mod for English FTL community.

The aim of this repository is to document progress on the English translation's progress.

Currently the English version of the mod is up to date with v1.27.1 of the original game. I am working on implementing the v1.28-1.29 main update of the mod, the Hyperspace update.
